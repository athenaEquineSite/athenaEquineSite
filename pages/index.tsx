        <div className={stylesHome.companyDescription}>
            <p>The origins of Athena Equine do not go far back in time. Two founders of the idea met in september 2020 for a short interview. Ended up talking for several hours about the same visions and dreams how to improve the horse care and services in the area of Indre Ostfold. This company was created to provide the best care and service for horses and their owners and riders. The strongest suit of our team is that we combine expierience from variuos equine environments, dressage, jumping, eventing or even long distance racing, breeding and livery yards. </p>
            <p>Athena Equine is based in Trogstad, in two subjected yards - Stall Kolbj√∏rnrud Hestepensjonat and Solberg Gard. Both yards meet every need of every horse and their owner. </p>
            <p>The team of Athena Equine is four vigorous women, who put their hearts into this job. That provides the highest level of care of our four-legged friends.</p>
            <p>With all that combined, we put all the effort in making sure that your horse has the best life possible at our yards.</p>
